# 2020-PET-predict-EF-after-Revasc_TVL
This project contains the analysis for the paper on FDG-PET and improvement in ejection fraction after revascularization by Luong TV et al.

## Research question
The aim of this study was to investigate if dynamic 18F-FDG-PET can predict improvement in left ventricular ejection-fraction (:EF) in patients with heart failure (:HF) undergoing revascularization.

## About this repository
The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency about the analysis and allow other researchers to *replicate* the analysis. Due to privacy concerns, the original data is NOT available in the repository. Thus, it is not possible *reproduce* the analysis presented in the paper. Upon request, the corresponding author will detail restrictions to data availability and under which conditions access to some of the data may be provided.

# Statistical Analysis Plan
This section describes the SAP in terms of:
1. Definitions of exposure variables
2. Definitions of outcomes
3. Statistics
4. Layout of planned tables
5. Layout of planned figures
6. Change log

## 1) Exposure variables




## 2) Outcome variables




## 3) Statistics


Analyses will be performed in Stata Statistical Software v 16.1 (College Station, Texas 77845 USA).


## 4) Table shells




## 5) Figure layout





## 6) Change log
This section describes the development of the prespecified SAP (before inspection of data), as well as any later changes to the SAP after inspection of data, reviewer comments, after acceptance, etc.
Changes in the code is documented on GitHub in the "commits" section, and will not be described below, unless changes:
1. are related to changes in the SAP,
2. affect results or interpretation of results substantially,
3. or are integrated after submission/acceptance/publication/etc.
